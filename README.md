s# New-Calculator
A small app writen to teach myself coding in VB
This has taken a week to write, coding a few bits then debugging each day. This is the second version, written initially to debug the first version.

Enter numbers followed by operators. Operators are math buttons to perform an action.
Answers are only displayed when either another number button is pressed or the EQUALS button
Zero division errors are captured via a Message Box, which displays a request to input a number.

The main code is structured. Repeated code is Functionised and called as appropriate.
Comments in the code are added to describe the flow.

Any issues please advise. Any requests for updates or ammendments, please contact myself.
